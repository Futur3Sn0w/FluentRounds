# What is 'FluentRounds' ?
**FluentRounds** is an icon pack based on Microsoft's Fluent Icons, created and adapted to a rounded-rectangle shape.
FluentRounds is built with a mobile-first mindset, to ensure the icons are always pixel-perfect on the small-screen.

## Downloading FluentRounds
You can download the full set of FluentRounds icons from this page, and use them on your mobile device (details below).

### Android
On Android, you have a few options.
1. If your device has an unlocked bootloader (or has a bootloader that can be unlocked), then you can install a custom ROM on your device, and apply the icons system-wide.
2. If you cannot root your device, or don't want to, you can download a 3rd party launcher, such as Lawnchair v2 or Nova Launcher. You'll have to change each individual icon this way, but it's currently the only option for now.
3. If you want to use your device's stock launcher, you can use an app shortcut creation tool to create a shortcut for each app. Again, it's not ideal, but it works.
4. (**NOT YET AVAILABLE**) You can download the icon-pack from the play store and apply the pack through a launcher such as Lawnchair v2 or Nova Launcher.

### iOS
On iOS, you have a few options.
1. If your device **is** jailbroken, you can download the Snowboard tweak, and double-tap an icon in jiggle mode to change it. There is a tweak that lets you change icons within an app, but I can't seem to remember what it's called. I'll note it here when I figure it out.
2. If your device is **not** jailbroken, you can use a 3rd party tool, such as iCustom from TooliPhone to create a web-based shortcut to the app of your choosing.
3. If your device is **not** jailbroken, you can use Apple's Shortcuts app to create custom shortcuts for the apps of your choosing. You can find tutorials for this online.
4. (**NOT YET AVAILABLE**) If your device **is** jailbroken, you can download the theme from my repo.
I do plan to send the pack to a more public repo, such as Twickd, in the future. Stay tuned on Twitter for updates!

## Getting updates
If you're interested in getting the latest updates, you can check out my Twitter (linked below). I don't always post about the icons, but you'll know when I do over there.

## Questions? Comments? Requests?
I do have plans to add more icons, especially ones that are stock for mobile devices, such as files and contacts. <br>
I am currently working on many projects, as well as attending college, so these icons aren't always a priority. Please check my Twitter for updates!
